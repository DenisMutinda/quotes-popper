# Quote-popper

A *nix script written in C that pops a random quote in a random time period - usually 10 minutes to a quarter of an hour.\
It utilises the **`notify-send`** bundled with the system DE.

## Path of Development

- [x] Read qoutes from a .txt file.
- [x] Display the qoute as a system notification.
- [x] Sleep for a random between 10 to 15 minutes.
- [ ] Add more qoutes.
- [ ] Randomise the qoute picked.

## Future plans

- [ ] Can use this to form the skeleton of my To-Do List.
